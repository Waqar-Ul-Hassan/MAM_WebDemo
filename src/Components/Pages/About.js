        My name is Waqar! Currently I am in Software Engineering II at McMaster
        University. I am passionate about web/app development as well as
        hardware assembly through micro-controllers.
        <br />
        <br />I originally got into the interest of the technology industry in
        grade 9, this is when I began learning how to code in basic markups such
        as html. Then, through the few years of high school I decided that I
        really enjoyed the program development as I learned a wide range of
        languages such as, java script, java, python, lua script, C++, and
        swift.Â  Later I was able to implement my knowledge of programming with
        my knowledge of hardware, this drew my interest into micro-controllers.
        In my spare time learning how to create small projects with arduinos and
        rasberry pi's is something that I have come to truly appreciate. Some
        small projects I have worked on include, car parking sensors, thermostat
        with display, and a L.E.D music interactive box. Additionally, I also
        enjoy reading some books on theory as well as going on walks and trails
        to release any stress and tension caused due to worldly needs.
